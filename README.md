# Quantum Mau-Mau Game

"Quantum Mau-Mau" represents a captivating fusion of traditional card game strategies and quantum computing principles. Players embark on a unique journey, endeavoring to shed their hand of cards before any of their opponents, with an array of tools at their disposal.

## Core Components

The strategic depth of "Quantum Mau-Mau" is built upon several key components:

- Quantum Operation Cards: These cards represent various quantum operations that you can deploy, such as Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Hadamard (H), and Controlled NOT (CNOT), among others.
- Delete Quantum Operation Cards: An antithesis to their creation counterparts, these cards are capable of removing quantum operations from play.
- Quantum Circuit: A digital playground where players conduct their quantum operations, made visible through a user-friendly interface.
- Measurement Cards: Special cards that serve as the catalyst for measuring the current state of the Quantum Circuit.
- Quantum Computer API: A digital bridge connecting the game to an actual quantum computer. This API enables the execution of the Quantum Circuit and delivers the results of the quantum state measurements.

## The Journey of Gameplay

Gameplay commences with a thorough shuffle of the Quantum Operation Cards and Measurement Cards, after which each player is dealt 7 cards. The remaining stack serves as the draw pile.

In a clockwise sequence, players take turns, beginning with the first player. Choices on each turn include playing an operation card on the quantum circuit, applying it to any qubit, or playing a measurement card, or a combination of these actions.

By playing an operation card, a player can strategically apply the operation to any qubit in the quantum circuit based on the current circuit situation.

Playing a measurement card results in an exciting progression, where the Quantum Circuit's current state is sent to a real quantum computer for execution. In the aftermath, all players (excluding the one who played the measurement card) have to draw cards based on the most probable outcome of the quantum measurement, which is displayed in binary. This action resets the circuit.

If a player's turn does not yield an operation or measurement card play, they must draw a card from the pile. If the drawn card is playable, it can be used immediately; if not, the turn concludes.

A thrilling aspect of the game is the potential for quantum entanglement. Certain circuit constructions enable players to intertwine their qubits with those of others. This capability allows operations to be applied to multiple qubits simultaneously but also means that measurements will impact all entangled qubits.

The game concludes when a player successfully depletes their hand of cards, with that player being declared the victor. If the draw pile gets exhausted before any player wins, the game terminates prematurely, and the player holding the fewest cards wins.

## Additional Rules

- Players must maintain a minimum of one card in their hand until they emerge as the winner.
- If the Quantum Operation Cards deck depletes, the discard pile can be reshuffled to replenish the deck.
- Only one card can be played per turn unless a special card permits multiple plays.
- If a player is unable to play a card, they must draw from the pile, thus concluding their turn.
- A measurement card can be used immediately after applying a Quantum Operation Card.

## Strategy Nuggets

"Quantum Mau-Mau" is a game rich in strategic options. Players need to exercise judicious timing when playing their operation and measurement cards to minimize their draw pile and maximize the draw for other players. The concept of quantum entanglement injects an additional strategic layer, demanding players to manage their entanglements effectively to avoid unwanted card draws. Anticipating the most likely outcome of quantum measurement is a crucial skill, as it directly influences the number of cards each player has to draw.
